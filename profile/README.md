## Welcome to Dearborn Coding Club! 👋

### Dearborn Coding Club Vision Statement

Our vision is to build a community of belonging, where we can grow and learn together. We aim to bring together aspiring and experienced veterans  to socialize, collaborate, and fraternize, fostering a community where mutual understanding, safety, personal development and compassion are prevalent. Through weekly gatherings, we strive to create a space that inspires innovation and the pursuit of intellectual curiosity.

🙋‍♀️ We're a small coding group in Dearborn, Michigan, that likes to build cool stuff.

🌈 Feel free to come to one of our meetups and contribute! We only ask that you be respectful and work in pull requests and issues.

🍿 We usually meet up at the same coffee shop at the same time each week!

🧙 Remember, have fun!
