## Welcome to Dearborn Coding Club! 👋

🙋‍♀️ We're a small coding group in Dearborn, Michigan, that likes to build cool stuff.

🌈 Feel free to come to one of our meetups and contribute! We only ask that you be respectful and work in pull requests and issues.

👩‍💻 Check out our meetup page [here](https://www.meetup.com/dearborn-coding-club/).

🍿 We usually meet up at the same coffee shop at the same time each week!

🧙 Remember, have fun!
